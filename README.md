Welcome to the **React To-Do List** project! 🚀 This project simulates a social media feed, featuring functionalities such as commenting, applauding, and deleting comments. It is a React application using Vite, designed to practice important React concepts, including componentization, props, state, immutability, and hooks. Additionally, TypeScript is applied to add static typing to the application.

Inspired by a tutorial from [RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

Initial design available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/LEqdd2mzfcSPJn0LnT1Vbl/React-To-Do-List).

This is a sleek and modern feed application built using the latest web technologies: **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite** and **CSS Modules**.
