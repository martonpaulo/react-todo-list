This project is a simple **to-do list** application built with React, designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add new tasks, mark or deselect tasks as completed, and delete tasks from the list. Additionally, the app displays the progress of task completion, providing an overview of the user's productivity. The project demonstrates key React concepts such as state management, immutability, lists and keys, props, and componentization.
